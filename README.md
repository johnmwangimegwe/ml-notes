# Machine Learning Notes ~ Zindua School
Access the notes your technical mentors used to teach your live classes in your machine learning modules. The folders are based on your class, but you are free to explore notes from previous classes (and other technical mentors) to enrich your knowledge. In every class folder, notes will be structured as follows:
1. Notebooks covering the weekly content usually named as : `week-##-...`
2. Any data files used in the weekly content, usually available in a data subfolder
3. Additionally, the `kaggle-guide` folder (separate from the class notes) contains a general guide for working on Kaggle projects
